**Custom Scripting Sandbox Environment**

Our application features a custom scripting sandbox environment that allows users to run JavaScript scripts safely while preventing code injection. This sandbox environment is designed to provide a secure and controlled environment for executing scripts, ensuring that users can harness the power of JavaScript without compromising the integrity of our application.

**Key Features:**

- **Safe Execution:** Scripts are executed in a controlled environment, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data or system resources.

- **Code Injection Prevention:** The sandbox environment includes robust security measures to prevent code injection attacks, ensuring the integrity of the application.

- **Customization:** Users can customize the database in anyway they want through these custom scripts, but any functionality past that is not allowed.

- **Error Handling:** The sandbox environment includes robust error handling mechanisms to ensure that any errors in the scripts are gracefully handled without impacting the application.

**How to Use:**

To use the scripting sandbox environment, simply write your JavaScript code in the provided editor and click the "Run" button. The environment will execute your script in a safe and secure manner, providing you with the results.

**Note:** While the sandbox environment is designed to be secure, it's important to exercise caution when executing scripts from untrusted sources. Always review scripts carefully before running them in the sandbox.
